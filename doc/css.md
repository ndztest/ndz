Several base styles are included that build upon `Normalize.css`. These
styles:

* provide basic typography settings that improve text readability
* protect against unwanted `text-shadow` during text highlighting
* tweak the default alignment of some elements (e.g.: `img`, `video`,
  `fieldset`, `textarea`)
* style the prompt that is displayed to users using an outdated browser
* and more...

These styles are included in [main.css](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/css/main.css). See the [main.css](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css) project [documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css/blob/master/README.md#features) for a full discussion of these styles.
